# COMP2001
COMP2001 Computer Science project - API, PHP, etc.
This repository consists of two parts: a RESTful API created based on a specification given, this API interacts with stored procedures in the database using HTTP (POST, PUT, DELETE, UPDATE); the second part is a PHP application that displays a dataset in a way readable for humans (a table), and a machine readable format (jason).
The API project included making Tables, Stored Procedures and a Trigger (for which the SQL is in this repository) stored in an external SQL server. 
The PHP project was created using a template (https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_interior_design.htm). On a seperate page in the PHP application the data is displayed in a format readable for humans.
